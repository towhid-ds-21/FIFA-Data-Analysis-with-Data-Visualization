FIFA 19, as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series, is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver. It was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, the Nintendo switch and Microsoft Windows on 28 September 2018 for its press conference E3 2018 and was announced in the FIFA 26th installment. Like FIFA 18, Cristiano Ronaldo is the cover athlete for the regular edition: however, the new cover art, Neymar, Kevin De Bruyne and Paulo Dybala, was released following its undesired shift from the Spanish Club Real Madrid to Italian side Juventus.
