FIFA 19, as part of Electronic Arts' FIFA series, is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver. It was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, the Nintendo switch and Microsoft Windows on 28 September 2018 for its press conference E3 2018 and was announced in the FIFA 26th installment. Like FIFA 18, Cristiano Ronaldo is the cover athlete for the regular edition: however, the new cover art, Neymar, Kevin De Bruyne and Paulo Dybala, was released following its undesired shift from the Spanish Club Real Madrid to Italian side Juventus.
The game features for the first time club competitions of the UEFA, including the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Martin Tyller and Alan Smith return as main analysts, while the current commentary team of Derek Rae and Lee Dixon is part of the UEFA competition mode. The first FIFA 17 figure, Alex Hunter, is back for the third and final edition of 'The Journey,' called 'The Journey: Champions,' and introduced the FIFA Women's World Cup for a free update in the June 2019 gamers as a separate feature.
It was tough for me to complete the project. That's why, I need to revise more for better understanding.
